         <p>If someone asks me what the summer song of 2016 is, it's definitely the latest single by The Chainsmokers and Halsey.
          I feel like every song I pick out has a heartbreaking element, but maybe that's because that's the true nature of the beast.
           Love, in all of its forms, is beautiful.</p>

         <p>In the first verse, Andrew Taggart (one of the two members of The Chainsmokers) sings, "Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you / I drink too much and that's an issue but I'm okay." He's setting a scene in which he sees an old friend (who we'll find out later is an ex-girlfriend). He acknowledges that part of the problem their relationship didn't work out was because he would get drunk. He knows it's wrong, but he wants to not talk about it for now.</p>

         <p>The studio lothario auteur Ty Dolla $ign has a new album/mixtape-type thing called Campaign coming out in a couple of weeks, and we’ve already posted the title track (with Future), “3 Wayz” (with Travis Scott), and the single “Zaddy.” Today, he’s shared the fun, bluesy acoustic number “Stealing,” which is musically pretty close to “Solid,” the Babyface collab that Ty$ released last year. The conceit is simple enough: Ty$ is lamenting that he’s a criminal because he keeps “stealing all these bitches’ hearts.” Listen to it below.</p>

         <p>Even for Donald Trump, the distance is still fun to think about, up here in his penthouse 600 ft. in the sky, where it’s hard to make out the regular people below. The ice skaters swarming Central Park’s Wollman Rink look like old-television static, and the Fifth Avenue holiday shoppers could be mites in a gutter. To even see this view, elevator operators, who spend their days standing in place, must push a button marked 66–68, announcing all three floors of Trump’s princely pad. Inside, staff members wear cloth slipcovers on their shoes, so as not to scuff the shiny marble or stain the plush cream carpets.</p>
